# Magic-8-Ball
Ask questions and let the Magic 8 Ball answer.

**Description**  This is a simple web page that simulates a magic eight ball. It asks the user for their name and a question, and then provides an answer in the provided space. It also includes a selection of suggested questions for the input box. The user's name is saved using local storage when they choose to "ask another question," and the form is cleared on page reload.
